# CDP Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the WebPush API's integration with Customer Data Platforms (CDP), detailing the data flow, synchronization processes, and implementation guidelines based on the CDP integration flow diagram.

## Integration Architecture

The CDP integration follows a bidirectional data flow that enables:
- Sending user interaction data from WebPush to the CDP
- Receiving enriched user profiles from the CDP to enhance targeting

## Data Flow Process

The activity diagram illustrates the following process flow:

1. **User Activity Collection**: 
   - System captures user interactions from multiple sources (web, app, WebPush notifications)
   - Each interaction is categorized by source and context

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Raw interaction data is transformed into a standardized format
   - Timestamps, event types, and user identifiers are normalized
   - Device-specific attributes are extracted and standardized

3. **CDP Payload Preparation**:
   - Data is organized into the CDP's expected schema
   - User identifiers are mapped between systems
   - Events are enriched with contextual metadata

4. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data is sent to CDP via secure API endpoints
   - Transfer uses authentication tokens and HTTPS
   - Payload signatures ensure data integrity

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Failed transfers trigger the retry mechanism
   - Exponential backoff strategy prevents overwhelming the CDP
   - Critical failures alert administrators
   - Errors are logged for troubleshooting

6. **Profile Synchronization**:
   - CDP processes received data to update user profiles
   - Updated profiles can be pulled back to WebPush
   - User segments are recalculated based on new data

## Implementation Details

### API Integration

The WebPush API connects to the CDP using:

```python
# CDP service configuration
CDP_API_URL = settings.CDP_API_URL
CDP_API_KEY = settings.CDP_API_KEY
CDP_TIMEOUT = 30  # seconds
```

### Data Types Sent to CDP

1. **User Profile Data**:
   - Demographics
   - Communication preferences
   - Subscription status
   - Device information

2. **Interaction Events**:
   - Notification deliveries
   - Opens and clicks
   - Conversions
   - Opt-ins and opt-outs

3. **Campaign Data**:
   - Campaign exposures
   - A/B test participations
   - Content preferences inferred from interactions

### Data Format Example

```json
{
  "user_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "event_type": "notification_click",
  "timestamp": "2023-04-12T15:23:45.123Z",
  "properties": {
    "notification_id": "9f8e7d6c-5b4a-3210-9876-543210fedcba",
    "campaign_id": "abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "device_type": "mobile",
    "browser": "chrome",
    "os": "android",
    "content_category": "promotion"
  },
  "context": {
    "source": "webpush",
    "app_version": "2.1.3",
    "location": "product_page"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling & Retry Logic

The system handles CDP connection issues using:

1. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Initial retry after 30 seconds
   - Exponential backoff with maximum 1-hour delay
   - Maximum 5 retry attempts
   - Events are stored in Redis until delivered

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Failed transfers are logged with full context
   - Critical failures trigger alerts to administrators
   - Transfer statistics are available in the admin dashboard

## Profile Synchronization

The CDP integration offers two synchronization modes:

1. **Push Mode** (WebPush → CDP):
   - Real-time event forwarding
   - Batch user profile updates
   - Campaign performance metrics

2. **Pull Mode** (CDP → WebPush):
   - Scheduled profile enrichment
   - Segment membership updates
   - Propensity scores and user insights

## Security Considerations

The CDP integration implements these security measures:

1. **Authentication**:
   - API key authentication
   - OAuth 2.0 token-based authorization (optional)

2. **Data Protection**:
   - TLS 1.2+ for all transfers
   - Payload encryption for sensitive data
   - PII handling according to GDPR requirements

3. **Access Control**:
   - Limited system accounts with CDP access
   - Audit logging for all data transfers
   - IP restriction for CDP connections

## Configuration Options

Administrators can configure the CDP integration through:

```
/api/v1/cdp/settings (POST, GET)
```

Available settings include:

- Enable/disable integration
- Synchronization frequency
- Event filtering options
- Error handling preferences
- Field mapping configuration

## Troubleshooting

Common CDP integration issues and resolutions:

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Connection timeouts | Network issues or CDP API overloaded | Check network, verify CDP status, implement circuit breaker |
| Authentication failures | Expired or invalid API keys | Rotate API keys, verify credentials in settings |
| Data mapping errors | Schema changes in CDP | Update field mappings, validate payload structure |
| Rate limiting | Too many requests to CDP | Implement request throttling, batch events |

## Monitoring

The integration provides monitoring endpoints:

```
/api/v1/cdp/health (GET)
/api/v1/cdp/metrics (GET)
/api/v1/cdp/logs (GET)
```

Key metrics tracked:
- Data transfer volume
- Sync success/failure rates
- API response times
- Error frequencies
- Profile update statistics
