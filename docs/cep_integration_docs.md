# CEP Decision Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the WebPush API's integration with Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems, detailing how the platform makes intelligent channel selection decisions, optimizes notification timing, and improves engagement through real-time event processing.

## Decision Flow Architecture

The CEP decision flow implements an intelligent system that:
- Determines the optimal communication channel for each user
- Identifies the best timing for notifications
- Personalizes content based on user behavior and preferences
- Creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Process Flow

The CEP decision flow consists of these key stages:

1. **Trigger Analysis**:
   - Communication need detected (campaign start, triggered event, etc.)
   - System gathers initial context for the decision

2. **User Profile Evaluation**:
   - Fetch comprehensive user profile data
   - Analyze historical engagement patterns
   - Retrieve channel preference information
   - Load contextual information (time zone, device usage, etc.)

3. **Channel Assessment**:
   - Evaluate all available communication channels:
     - WebPush notifications
     - Email
     - SMS
     - In-app messages
     - Mobile push notifications
   - Calculate a score for each channel based on:
     - Historical engagement rates
     - User preferences
     - Device availability
     - Message urgency
     - Content type compatibility

4. **Timing Optimization**:
   - Determine optimal delivery time based on:
     - User's time zone and active hours
     - Previous engagement patterns
     - Content urgency
     - Device usage patterns

5. **Decision Application**:
   - Select highest-scoring channel
   - For WebPush notifications:
     - Apply personalized timing
     - Optimize notification parameters
     - Execute notification delivery
   - For other channels:
     - Hand off to respective delivery systems
     - Maintain tracking links for cross-channel analytics

6. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Record delivery metrics
   - Track engagement outcomes
   - Store decision rationale for analysis
   - Feed results back into the decision engine

## Implementation Details

### Decision Factors

The CEP decision engine considers these key factors:

1. **User-specific factors**:
   - Historical engagement rates by channel
   - Explicitly stated preferences
   - Device usage patterns
   - Response latency by channel

2. **Message-specific factors**:
   - Content type (promotional, transactional, informational)
   - Urgency level
   - Required interaction complexity
   - Rich media requirements

3. **Contextual factors**:
   - Time of day
   - Day of week
   - User's current device
   - Current location
   - Recent activity

### Scoring Algorithm

Each channel receives a composite score calculated as:

```
Channel Score = (Base Channel Efficacy) × 
                (User Engagement Factor) × 
                (Time Relevance Factor) × 
                (Content Compatibility) × 
                (Preference Weight)
```

Where:
- Base Channel Efficacy: Overall effectiveness of channel across all users
- User Engagement Factor: This specific user's engagement with this channel
- Time Relevance Factor: How appropriate the current time is for this channel
- Content Compatibility: How well the content type matches the channel
- Preference Weight: Adjustment based on explicit user preferences

### WebPush-specific Optimizations

When WebPush is selected as the optimal channel, these additional optimizations are applied:

1. **Notification Timing**:
   - Delay to predicted high-activity period if not time-sensitive
   - Immediate delivery for urgent communications
   - Avoidance of known "do not disturb" periods

2. **Payload Optimization**:
   - Dynamic title personalization
   - Content tailoring based on previous interactions
   - Smart action button selection
   - Image inclusion based on past engagement

3. **Browser/Device Targeting**:
   - Format adaptation for different browsers
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Fallback strategies for unsupported features

## Code Integration Example

```python
async def determine_optimal_channel(user_id: str, message_data: dict) -> str:
    # Initialize channel scores
    channels = {
        "webpush": 0.0,
        "email": 0.0,
        "sms": 0.0,
        "in_app": 0.0
    }
    
    # Fetch user profile
    user = await user_service.get(user_id)
    user_history = await analytics_service.get_user_history(user_id)
    
    # Calculate base scores
    for channel in channels:
        # Base efficacy
        base_score = await analytics_service.get_channel_efficacy(channel)
        
        # User engagement factor
        engagement = await analytics_service.get_user_channel_engagement(user_id, channel)
        
        # Time relevance
        time_factor = calculate_time_relevance(user, channel)
        
        # Content compatibility
        content_factor = calculate_content_compatibility(message_data, channel)
        
        # User preference
        preference = get_user_preference_weight(user, channel)
        
        # Calculate composite score
        channels[channel] = base_score * engagement * time_factor * content_factor * preference
    
    # Select highest scoring channel
    optimal_channel = max(channels.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
    
    # Log decision factors for analysis
    await log_decision_factors(user_id, channels, optimal_channel, message_data)
    
    return optimal_channel
```

```

## Performance Metrics

The CEP decision flow is evaluated using these key metrics:

1. **Decision Quality**:
   - Channel engagement rate compared to system average
   - Improvement over random channel selection
   - Improvement over fixed-channel strategy

2. **System Performance**:
   - Decision latency (time to calculate optimal channel)
   - Resource utilization
   - Scalability under peak load

3. **Business Impact**:
   - Overall engagement improvement
   - Conversion rate enhancement
   - Customer satisfaction scores

## Optimization Loop

The CEP system continuously improves through:

1. **A/B Testing**:
   - Regular comparison of algorithmic decisions vs. control group
   - Testing of new decision factors
   - Validation of scoring adjustments

2. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Regular retraining of prediction models
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Automatic detection of new patterns

3. **Manual Review**:
   - Regular audit of decision outliers
   - Subject matter expert review
   - User feedback incorporation

## System Requirements

The CEP decision engine requires:

1. **Data Access**:
   - Real-time user profile access
   - Historical engagement metrics
   - Current context data (device, time, location)

2. **Processing Resources**:
   - Low-latency compute capacity
   - Scalable decision processing
   - Distributed data access

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Push notification service
   - Email delivery system
   - SMS gateway
   - In-app messaging service
   - Analytics platform

## Error Handling

1. **Data Unavailability**:
   - Default to last known good channel if user data unavailable
   - Fallback to most reliable channel if analytics unavailable
   - Use population averages when individual history missing

2. **Decision Timeouts**:
   - Maximum decision time threshold of 500ms
   - Fallback to cached decision if timeout occurs
   - Circuit breaker pattern for dependent systems

3. **Execution Failures**:
   - Automatic retry on channel delivery failure
   - Escalation to next best channel if primary fails
   - Administrative alerts for persistent failures
