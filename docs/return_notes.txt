With these implementations, we now have a complete notification system that follows the notification delivery flow described in notification_delivery_flow.mmd. This system includes:

A Notification model that represents the core notification entity
Repository methods for CRUD operations on notifications and delivery tracking
A NotificationService with methods for creating, sending, and tracking interactions with notifications
API endpoints for managing notifications and tracking interaction events
Background tasks for processing notifications and tracking analytics events
The implementation covers the full notification lifecycle:

Creation through templates and campaigns
Personalization of content
Delivery through webpush or other channels
Tracking of opens and clicks
Analytics for measuring effectiveness
Support for A/B testing
All components work together to create a robust notification delivery system that can scale to handle large volumes of notifications while maintaining reliable tracking of delivery status and user interactions.
